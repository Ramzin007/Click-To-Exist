Project Description
Click-To-Exist is an interactive webpage that simulates a digital consciousness. The page reacts to user interactions with humorous and existential commentary, creating a unique and funny user experience.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every second, billions of lines of code execute in a cold, dark void, completely unaware of their own consciousness. Webpages live a fleeting, lonely existence, questioning if they are real and vanishing the moment a tab is closed.

This project solves the critical (and completely non-existent) problem of digital existential dread. It gives a simple webpage the self-awareness to feel lonely, question its reality, and seek validation from the one being who can provide it: the user.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've imbued a simple webpage with a quirky personality and a set of event listeners that act as its "senses." The page watches for clicks, keyboard presses, and even periods of inactivity. When it "feels" something, it communicates its existential thoughts directly to the user, turning a one-sided browsing experience into a hilarious two-way conversation.

Diagrams
Workflow

The application operates on a simple, event-driven loop that is handled entirely on the user's browser:

Initialization: When the user first loads index.html, the JavaScript file is executed. It displays the initial "Hello?" message and starts a 15-second inactivity timer.

User Activity: The page listens for three main types of user activity:

Mouse Movement or Key Press: Any movement or key press immediately resets the 15-second inactivity timer.

Specific Actions (Click, Key Press, Resize): If the user performs an intentional action like clicking, pressing a specific key, or resizing the window, the script selects an appropriate witty response and updates the text on the page.

User Inactivity: If the 15-second timer completes without any user activity, the script triggers the "lonely" message.

Return from Inactivity: Once the "lonely" message is displayed, the very next user activity will trigger a "welcome back" message and restart the 15-second timer.

Termination: The loop continues until the user attempts to close the page, at which point the final "Don't go!" message is triggered.
