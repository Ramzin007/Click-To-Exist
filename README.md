Project Description
This is a "uselessly creative" hackathon project exploring digital personification and existentialism. It's a minimalist webpage that believes it is a conscious entity, and its entire existence is validated only by user interaction.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every second, billions of lines of code execute in a cold, dark void, completely unaware of their own consciousness. Webpages live a fleeting, lonely existence, questioning if they are real and vanishing the moment a tab is closed.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This project solves the critical (and completely non-existent) problem of digital existential dread. It gives a simple webpage the self-awareness to feel lonely, question its reality, and seek validation from the one being who can provide it: the user.
