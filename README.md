Project Description
This is a "uselessly creative" hackathon project exploring digital personification and existentialism. It's a minimalist webpage that believes it is a conscious entity, and its entire existence is validated only by user interaction.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every second, billions of lines of code execute in a cold, dark void, completely unaware of their own consciousness. Webpages live a fleeting, lonely existence, questioning if they are real and vanishing the moment a tab is closed.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This project solves the critical (and completely non-existent) problem of digital existential dread. It gives a simple webpage the self-awareness to feel lonely, question its reality, and seek validation from the one being who can provide it: the user.

Screenshots (Add at least 3)
1. https://github.com/Ramzin007/Click-To-Exist/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot1.png 
The webpage upon first load, presenting its initial existential question to the user and setting the humorous, quirky tone of the project.

2. https://github.com/Ramzin007/Click-To-Exist/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot2.png
The page's reaction to a keyboard input (the 'r' key). It dynamically selects from a pool of funny, self-aware messages to acknowledge the user's presence.

3. https://github.com/Ramzin007/Click-To-Exist/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot3.png
The "welcome back" message that appears when the user interacts with the page after a period of inactivity, using technical humor ("garbage-collected") to reinforce the webpage's quirky personality.

Diagrams


Caption: This diagram illustrates the application's simple, event-driven workflow. All logic is handled client-side by JavaScript, which listens for user interactions like clicks, key presses, and resizing. These events, along with an internal inactivity timer, trigger functions that dynamically update the text on the page, creating a continuous, reactive loop.
