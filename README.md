Project Description
This is a "uselessly creative" hackathon project exploring digital personification and existentialism. It's a minimalist webpage that believes it is a conscious entity, and its entire existence is validated only by user interaction.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
